            <h4>
                What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </h4>

                <p>
                    I have definitely learned to humble myself and be open to asking for help from others. It is something I am not used to because as much as I can, I will do things on my own and not bother other people. But with coding, I realised that it is different. It is okay to ask for help, and often, when asking for help, you get to expand your learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have learned to embrace emotions of fear and anxiety and to just experience them as they come. I realised that it is okay to feel them and that it is natural when learning new things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I learned that being persistent and determined are key for me to be able to see this course to the end. I have encountered many challenges that I have overcome, and each time I meet a new one, the last one just seems to be easier in hindsight. 
                </p>

            <h4>
                What is the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </h4>

                <p>
                    It is important to recognise that each person is different. Each one of us has values that are unique to our experience and background, and this has to be considered when learning and working with people.
                </p>

            <h4>
                What has surprised you the most about core learning?
            </h4>

                <p>
                    Looking back at myself from a few weeks ago, I am surprised at how much learning I can take in. I have been struggling with new concepts and it has not been an easy 5 weeks. There were many times that I doubted if this was for me. But here I am now, coding and growing, and I am quite excited to see myself successfully finishing this course.
                </p>

            <h4>
                What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </h4>

                <p>
                    The most challenging parts of core Learning for me were the following:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <em>Discussing my identity and values.</em> These are things that I do not give that much thought to because life is too busy as it is. Frankly, who cares about who we are, right? But I learned that it is important to do some self-introspection so we are self aware of the things we are good at and the ones that need some work.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <em>Practicing a Growth Mindset.</em> It is not easy to convince yourself that you are going to be good at something eventually while you are struggling. But because science says that they have proven it works, then you just bet all your money on it. Thankfully, it does work.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            
                <h4>
                    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
                </h4>

                    <p>
                        Core learning has a huge impact on oneâ€™s ability to learn. Dealing with problems on a regular basis can be very stressful, mentally and emotionally, and if we do not know how to cope with these things or process our emotions, then we are bound to fail or simply give up, which would be counterproductive of our time and efforts invested in this.
                    </p>

                <h4>
                    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.
                </h4>

                    <p>
                        I think it has helped immensely in my learning. I definitely would not have gotten this far if not for the core learning materials that made sense of my struggles. And admittedly, I have just as much work to do on my human skills as in my programming skills, so I really appreciate that this course is meeting these two aspects at the same time.
