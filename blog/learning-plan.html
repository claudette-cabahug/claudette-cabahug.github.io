            Bootcamp Learning Plan

        <h4>
            My Long Term Plans
        </h4>
        
        <p>
            I am taking this course so that I can make a shift to a tech career by first quarter of 2022 and become a web developer that top tech companies in NZ would want to hire. I look forward
            to having the opportunity to be flexible with my time at work so I can have more time with my family. I hope
            to prove to myself that it is never too late to pick up on where I have left off with my dreams, pursue
            long-overdue goals, and be successful in doing so.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Strengths and Limitations
        </h4>

        <p>
            I believe that I was able to utilise my strengths to my advantage during Foundations and that they have
            helped me greatly in finishing the challenges. I have noticed that my assertiveness in establishing
            relationships with others have improved, as evident in my interactions in Slack and Discord, and I hope this
            will be reinforced further during bootcamp. I am also coming to terms with the fact that there is no way I
            can accomplish this programme by being an island. I have to reach out to others as well when I need help or
            offer help whenever I can.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Biggest Non-technical Challenge in Bootcamp
        </h4>

        <p>
            It would be managing my time at home and making it work with my studies. Having 2 children is hectic as it is. Add to the equation a mum going to an extensive programming bootcamp for a straight 9 weeks and it already makes me quite nervous just thinking about it. Really, what was I thinking going into this course, right? But I have sat down with my husband and he is very supportive. Whatever difficulty in the way just makes me even more motivated to succeed. 
        </p>

        <h4>
            Human Skills
        </h4>

        <p>
            By the end of this programme, I would like to see myself more confident in working and collaborating with others. I have so much anxiety around pair programming because I am not comfortable with other people discovering I do not know how to apply certain concepts or how to go about solving a problem. I hope that with more experience during bootcamp, I can become more comfortable about acknowledging my limitations and welcome this as an opportunity to learn from others.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Expectations from the Bootcamp Team
        </h4>

        <p>
            I expect the team to be supportive because not all of us have a programming background prior to starting Foundations, me being one of those. I am still not very confident about my programming and problem solving skills, even though I have tried my best going back to the concepts over and over again. I guess it just takes more time for some people.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Expectations of Myself
        </h4>

        <p>
            I commit to showing up on time every single day of bootcamp and bringing my whole self into it. I will do my best to actively participate in all activities. I will aim to make myself productive during my time on campus so that when I go home, I can also spend quality time with my family. I will devote 1-2 hours at night on weekdays for supplemental study/review. On weekends, I will devote my Saturday evenings and Sundays for review and some advance study, if possible, of the topics for the coming week. I promise to take care of myself by drinking and eating properly and making sure that I get enough sleep. I will show everyone respect and endeavour to cultivate a wonderful working relationship with others.
        </p>

                    <li>I will make sure to put in 8 hours of focused work/study every day from Monday to Friday. I will

                        this by using Toggle and the pomodoro method.</li>
                    <li>I will aim to practice coding every day within the 40 hours per week schedule for the course and
                        give
                        regular updates to my facilitator on my progress.</li>
                    <li>I will commit to make myself available whenever there are activities that EDA has prepared for

                    <li>Whenever I need more time to complete my tasks, I will communicate this with my facilitator in a
                        timely
                        way
                    </li>
                    <li>I will aim to have another outlet that can help clear my brain of stress and pressure, such as
                        exercising or
                        watching an episode of my favourite show on Netflix or going out with the family</li>
                    <li>I will write my feelings down on a journal/my reflections</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
                <p>I am highly motivated to finish this course and learn as much as I can so I will be ready to hit the
                    ground
                    running once it is completed. Thus, I commit to be open with my facilitator/s when it comes to my
                    learning
                    struggles and I will endeavour to do so in a timely manner. I will make sure my challenges will
                    constantly
                    be
                    raised and discussed during one-on-one check-ins, or sooner through DMs on Slack or e-mail, if
                    necessary.
                </p>

                <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h4>
                <p>As the course espouses flipped learning, I am aware that the facilitation team is there primarily to
                    guide me
                    as
                    a student in the right direction. Thus, I don’t expect them to be in daily correspondence with me.
                    Whenever
                    I
                    have an urgent problem, I know that I should first post the query on the proper Slack channels and
                    ask
                    help
                    from
                    my cohort before going to my facilitator. Any other concerns I have, I can wait until the next
                    check-in
                    to
                    discuss them.</p>
                <p>During bootcamp, however, as it will be held on campus, I do expect the facilitators to be present
                    onsite
                    as
                    well
                    during the times when I am required to be there. I’m sure this will greatly help me proceed with
                    projects
                    efficiently and it is also a good learning experience to be coached and trained as if in the actual
                    workplace.
                </p>

                <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For
                    example,
                    you
                    might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h4>
                <p>For the entire 5 weeks of Foundations, I will be working/studying from home. Since starting the
                    course
                    during
                    lockdown and with the children home during the day, I have been studying Monday to Friday from 3:00
                    PM
                    till
                    around midnight, with some interruption in between such as dinner time and cleaning up. Now that the
                    kids
                    are
                    back in school with the lowering of the alert level, I can study on weekdays from 9:30 AM till 7:00
                    PM,
                    with
                    interruptions in between for lunch and school pick-up.</p>
                <p>On weekends, I block off my Saturday morning until late afternoon to spend time with the family and
                    to go
                    with
                    the kids to their ballet and music lessons. For the rest of the weekend, I spend it doing chores and
                    also
                    practicing coding and watching video tutorials.</p>
