            <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
            <p><em>Emotional intelligence</em> is the ability to identify and express emotions, relate with others, and communicate socially. It is centered on a wide range of abilities, including:</p>
            <ul class="a">
                <li>Identifying emotions (self-awareness)</li>
                <li>Evaluating how others feel (motivation)</li>
                <li>Controlling one's own emotions (self-regulation)</li>
                <li>Perceiving how others feel (empathy)</li>
                <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication (social skills)</li>
                <li>Relating to others (social skills)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Having emotional intelligence</em> often translates to these 5 more observable behaviours:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ability to handle criticism without denial, blame, excuses or anxiety.</li>
                    <li>Being open-minded.</li>
                    <li>Being a good listener.</li>
                    <li>Ability to tell the truth without sugarcoating it.</li>
                    <li>Being able to apologize when wrong.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
            <p>IQ is basically a number that is quantified using a standardised intelligence exam based on the individual’s mental and chronological age, and in some cases, by comparing it to the average score of people belonging to the same age group. These tests are limited to measuring a person’s <em>visual and spatial processing, world knowledge, memory, and quantitative reasoning</em>.</p>
            <p>More limited and narrow than emotional intelligence, IQ does not cover the broad scope of human intelligence, although academic achievement is still considered an important element of success among many other influences. Also, in comparison to EQ, IQ is quite hard to change.</p>
            <p>However, rather than focusing on which between the two is the more important influence, it would serve us well to learn to improve our skills in multiple areas of holistic development for success.</p>

            <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
            <p>One’s ability to understand and express emotions play a very crucial role in how people fare (succeed) in life. It helps in building stronger relations, succeeding at school and work, and achieving career and personal goals. Further, EQ can help tap into our feelings, transform intention into action, and arrive at  informed decisions on matters that are most important to us.</p>
            <p>Today many companies have incorporated emotional intelligence tests and training as part of their hiring and human resource development programmes. Research findings have revealed that people with strong leadership potential are mostly those with high emotional intelligence. Therefore, employers look for this quality when hiring managers and business leaders. Particularly in the area of sales, studies also found that people tend to buy from people they like, and further, sales agents who have high EQ abilities such as self-confidence, initiative, and empathy are able to sell more expensive products than others.</p>
            <p><em>In web development</em>, having emotional intelligence means you will listen carefully to your client's needs and create a design that will enrich the users’ experience. It also means being able to embrace changes and show empathy when users respond negatively to certain aspects of the design. As a member of a team, it is important to be able to deal diligently with stress and situations wherein conflict would likely happen, which could then lead to non-productive behaviour. Thus, EQ is part of the essential skill sets for an engineer.</p>
            <p>What’s good news is that emotional intelligence is something that can be taught or strengthened. There are teaching strategies geared towards learning empathy, thinking about how others are feeling, and modelling positive behaviour.</p>
