            <h4>Examining and Reflecting on My Identity</h4>
            <p>I grew up in the small town of Danao City, Cebu, Philippines. My father was a seafarer while mother was a chemical engineer. I am the eldest child and I have a brother.</p>
            <p>Growing up, both my parents had to work, so I was mostly left with my grandmother. She was the barangay (village) chieftain then, so I have heaps of memories of her leading and meeting people. Hers was also the only dairy in our place back in the day, and I used to help her tend the store. But the fondest memories I have as a child was going to the farm with her. She used to say she had a green thumb and could practically grow anything. I was basically her little assistant in almost everything, whether in public office, small business, or on the farm during the planting and harvest seasons.</p>
            <p>I was raised in an environment wherein I see the women make the decisions. (Yeah, kind of like Themyscira, where the Amazons are from.) My father was mostly away for work, so my mother called the shots most of the time. My mum had a full-time job as an engineer at a papermill and then a cement company, but she also had several small businesses on the side. But no matter how busy or tired she was, at the end of the day she always made time to be my personal tutor, checking my school work and quizzing me on my lessons. She was very supportive about my studies and other activities outside of school. She had big dreams for her family, and she made them all come true.</p>
            <p>Moving to the city and into the big world to pursue my studies and life, in general, never really scared the country girl in me, as far as I can remember. I believe my confidence and real-life skills were unconsciously molded in me as I was growing up watching my two women heroes. I have always strived hard to do well in school, and I set big goals for myself. I am quite competitive because I was brought up to always give my best, although sometimes I guess it does not do well for my sanity when I push myself too hard.</p>
            <p>Thus, it did not come as a surprise to me when my personality tests came back to say that I am a perfectionist, detail seeker, logical, with low emotionality. The first two relate to my competitiveness, and the last two pertain to the side of me that is strong and practical.</p>
            <p>I did read back on the recommendations that my former colleagues at work submitted for me on Linkedin and for our visa application, and the common thing they said was that I am hardworking, patient, kind, helpful, dependable, and easy to work with. They also added that I have a positive attitude, which I know is one of my greatest strengths. In the last job I held, I was training a newbie who was adamant about doing the task assigned to her because she thought she was not yet ready to do it. Throughout the week, it was my positive attitude and constant encouragement that helped us get through that situation. It was surprising how she eventually embraced what she was expected to do and finished happy and proud of herself.</p>

            <h4>What’s at the Core of Who I Am</h4>
            <p>My greatest values are family, kindness and gratitude, and resilience. I consider my family as my greatest blessing. They are the reason I have joined Dev Academy -- so I can be in a position to be flexible with my work hours and I can spend more time with them. I also try to remind myself to never forget about my daughter’s cancer journey and how we emerged triumphantly from that dark phase in our life through the kindness of other people. If there’s anything I learned about myself in recent years, it is that I am a resilient person. In the face of challenges, I don’t give up and I do my best to overcome them. I think this is where I get my strength and confidence in joining Dev Academy, and it has helped me so far in completing the sprints.</p>
            <p>I am aware that being a detail seeker is a double-edged sword, so I am working on how I can keep myself to the good side of it without being too hard on myself or on others. My low assertiveness in a group setting, especially at work, in cases of conflict is largely due to my fear of disrupting established relationships with team members. I hope that through Dev Academy, I can improve my soft skills in relating to others in the midst of highly stressful situations. Lastly, I do not easily convey my thoughts or feelings, and I tend to do or resolve things on my own as long as I can. Thus, I hope to gain more experience in collaborating and working effectively with others, asking for help, as well as engaging and taking the time to get to know them.</p>
