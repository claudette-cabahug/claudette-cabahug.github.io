            <h4>My Identity and Cultural Influence</h4>
            <p>I grew up in the small town of Danao City, Cebu, Philippines. My father was a seafarer while my mother was a chemical engineer. I am the eldest child and I have a brother.</p>
            <p>Growing up, I was mostly left in the care of my grandmother. She was the <em>barangay</em> (village) chieftain then, so I have heaps of memories of her leading and meeting people. Hers was also the only dairy in our place back in the day, and I used to help her tend the store. But the fondest memories I have as a child was going to the farm with her. She used to say she had a green thumb and could practically grow anything. I was basically her wee assistant in almost everything, whether in public office, small business, or on the farm during the planting and harvest seasons.</p>
            <p>I was raised in an environment wherein I see <em>the women make the decisions</em>, which is quite contrary to the patriarchal Filipino culture at the time. (Yes, kind of like Themyscira, where the Amazons are from.) My father was mostly away for work, so my mother was the one calling the shots. My mum had a full-time job as an engineer at a papermill and then a cement company, but she also had several small businesses on the side. But no matter how busy or tired she was, at the end of the day she always made time to be my personal tutor, checking my school work and quizzing me on my lessons. She was very supportive about my studies and other activities outside of school. She had big dreams for her family, and she made them all come true.</p>
            <p>Moving to the city and into the big world to pursue my studies and life, in general, never really scared the country girl in me, as far as I can remember. I believe my <em>confidence and real-life skills</em> were unconsciously molded in me as I was growing up watching my two women heroes. I have always strived hard to do well in my endevours, and I set big goals for myself. I am quite <em>competitive</em> because I was brought up to always give my best, although sometimes I guess it does not do well for my sanity when I push myself too hard.</p>
            
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <p>My personality tests came back to say that I am a <em>perfectionist, detail seeker, logical, with low emotionality</em>. The first two relate to my competitiveness, and the last two pertain to the side of me that is strong and practical.</p>
            
            <p>The recommendations that my former colleagues at work submitted for me on Linkedin and for our visa application had a common thing to say: I am <em>hardworking, patient, kind, helpful, dependable, and easy to work with</em>. They also added that I have a <em>positive attitude</em>, which I know is one of my greatest strengths. 
            
            <h4>Experience Working with Resistance and Tension</h4>
            <p>In my former role at the Department of Corrections, I trained a new hire who was adamant about doing the new task assigned to her because she thought she was not yet ready for it. Throughout the week, it was my positive attitude and persistent encouragement of her that helped me get through that situation. It was surprising how she eventually embraced what she was expected to do and finished happy and proud of herself.</p>

            <h4>What’s at the Core of Who I Am</h4>
            <p>My greatest values are family, kindness and gratitude, and resilience. I consider my family as my greatest blessing. They are the reason I have joined Dev Academy -- so I can be in a position to be flexible with my work hours and I can spend more time with them. I also try to remind myself to never forget about my daughter’s cancer journey and how we emerged triumphantly from that dark phase in our life through the kindness of other people. If there’s anything I learned about myself in recent years, it is that I am a resilient person. In the face of challenges, I don’t give up and I do my best to overcome them. I think this is where I get my motivation to join Dev Academy, and it has helped me so far in completing the sprints. I am quite confident it will also see me through the entire course and thereafter.</p>

            <h4>Ethical Decision </h4>
            <p>I worked in the insurance industry for five years as a financial adviser. There were many times when my customers would try to make false health declarations in their insurance contracts so as to keep the premiums low. I always felt it was my responsibility to explain to them that if they make any misrepresentation, it might adversely affect any future claims. In these situations, I always abided by my public duty to be honest in my dealings with clients over the prospect of augmenting sales and exceeding sales targets. In the end, I never had any problems with my cients' insurance claims and I had a very good relationship with them. Some of them even became close family friends. In our culture, that is kind of really awesome.</p>

            <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <p>I am aware that being a detail seeker is a double-edged sword, so I am working on how I can keep myself to the good side of it without being too hard on myself or on others. My low assertiveness in a group setting, especially at work, in cases of conflict is largely due to my fear of disrupting established relationships with team members. I hope that through Dev Academy, I can improve my soft skills in relating to others in the midst of highly stressful situations. Lastly, I do not easily convey my thoughts or feelings, and I tend to do or resolve things on my own as best as I can. Thus, I hope to gain more experience in collaborating and working effectively with others, asking for help, as well as engaging and taking the time to get to know them.</p>
