    <h2>Class and ID: Best Practices Towards Writing Your Best Code</h2>

      <p>Two of the most widely used selectors for styling targeted HTML elements are classes and IDs. However, knowing
        when
        and how to use them can be quite challenging sometimes. While it is established that information which can be
        used
        multiple times should be kept in a class, data that is unique should be kept in an ID.</p>
      <p>Notice, though, their fundamental distinction:</p>
      <section>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
          <tr>
            <th>Class Attribute</th>
            <th>ID Attribute</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>used to specify a class for an HTML element</td>
            <td>used to specify a unique ID for an HTML element</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>multiple HTML elements can share the same class</td>
            <td>you cannot have more than one element with the same ID in an HTML document</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
      <p>Some would argue that IDs and classes can be used interchangeably if this means doing so will produce the
        result
        you want. To a certain extent, this is true. There is nothing you can do with an ID that you cannot do with
        class,
        and vice-versa. In fact, CSS does not really care which one you use.</p>
      <p>But the principles laid out above are no arbitrary rules randomly formulated to make life difficult. Other
        programming languages do care, particularly JavaScript, which greatly depends on the ID selector to be able to
        execute certain functions. Also, these rules form part of the generally accepted protocols and guidelines that
        must be observed to ensure code validation and, overall, the continuous long-term growth of the web.</p>
      <p>Here, I have come up with some of the best practices when using the CSS selectors class and ID so you can
        produce
        better outcomes when writing your best code yet.</p>
      <section>
        <p><strong>Minimalism.</strong> The use of these 2 selectors should be kept to a minimum and should mainly be to
          serve styling or visual, not structural, purposes. Plainly, if you do not need them, then do not use them.
          Using
          these attributes judiciously and semantically means avoiding this:</p>
        <img src="../images/minimalism.jpg" alt="incorrect use of class selector">
        <p>It is unnecessary to apply a class in this example as the anchor element obviously contains a link. Styling
          can
          already be applied using the tag alone.</p>
        <p><strong>Functionality and Practicality.</strong> Naming classes or IDs does not come easy all the time. But
          one way to go about it is by basing the class or ID on their function or meaning. For instance, there must be
          a
          strong connection between the class name, the style it applies, and the reason the styles are being applied.
        </p>
        <p>In the following illustration, there is a solid link between all three. Should you decide to change how the
          button looks like, chances are you will want to change every single instance of it throughout your site.</p>
        <img src="../images/button_class.jpg" alt="button class selector">
        <p>Similarly, use values that are practical in that they relate to the content, not to the style. Choosing names
          that pertain to how the selector works in relation to structure makes the code easy to understand or change,
          if
          necessary.</p>
        <p>The example below is not ideal because the color red describes the presentation of the content. In this case,
          when the style is changed, the HTML will also have to be changed.</p>
        <img src="../images/functionality1.jpg" alt="incorrect class selector example">
        <p>This one looks better:</p>
        <img src="../images/functionality2.jpg" alt="correct class selector example">
        <p><strong>Brevity.</strong> While there is no maximum limit for characters in CSS names, there is, however, a
          practical limit, especially if you want your code to render properly in different browsers. Ideally, though,
          names should be as short as possible, but they can be as long as necessary. For instance, a CSS file with 30
          classes of long names can add up and result in a huge performance issue on a large site. Also, consider how
          important bandwidth is when using the web on a mobile device. Heaps of long CSS names can slow down download
          of
          content, and that is inconsistent with good user experience.</p>
      </section>
      <p>At the end of the day, HTML will execute and render your code no matter how bad it is. The practices above are
        but standard ways of doing things that are generally observed because they are efficient, produce desirable
        results, and minimise the unpredictability of non-compliant codes.</p>
