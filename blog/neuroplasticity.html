            <h4>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>
            <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain's way of organising connections between neurons in our brain. With repeated
                practice of an activity, we allow our neurons to group and fire together to create
                electrochemical pathways, and this strengthens the connection between these cells.</p>

            <img src="../images/neuron.gif" alt="gif of neurons firing and making connections inside the brain"
                width="400" height="300">

            <p>Conversely, if we stop practising something, the neurons pertaining to such activity will
                eventually diminish. The more consistent a neuron is fired, the more it will also trigger the neurons surrounding it, thus
                ultimately resulting in a superhighway. If this pathway is stimulated consistently, it will become
                stronger and more efficient.</p>
            <p>To us, it simply means that with consistent practice, we get better at what we do. Imagine moving to live in another location that is unfamiliar to you. At first, it might be difficult to drive from your new address to the supermarket. Perhaps you will initially need Google Maps to guide you. However, after going about the same route over and over again, it gets easier and going to the same destination becomes like second nature to you.</p>
            <p>The concept is not only useful for people who are dreaming of
                making it to the Olympics or studying to become a web developer at 39 years old <span style="font-size:18px">&#128517</span>(like me). It can also be useful to
                improve one’s social life, relationship with co-workers, relationship with their partner, and virtually all areas of life. With the
                help of neuroplasticity, we just might live in a better world where more people are happy and fulfilled.</p>

            <h4>How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit</h4>
            <p>Understanding neuroplasticity will help me have more confidence in my learning journey. It means that the
                more I practice something, the more it will become
                permanent learning -- like building a super highway in my brain. I will discard false concepts about my intelligence and believe that I
                can learn new things and be very good at it. Finally, I am going to lessen activities that do not really
                contribute to my current goals so that my neurons can focus on making and strengthening connections
                relating to said objectives.</p>
            <p><em>So how do we hard-wire the connections in our brain?</em></p>

                    <li><code>Practice.</code> Repeat, retrieve, review.</li><br>
                    <li><code>Context.</code> Relate new learnings to activities that are already familiar so
                        the brain can create stronger neural connections and long-term memory retention.</li><br>
                    <li><code>Awareness.</code> Acknowledging and being empowered by what the brain can do and not
                        be limited by the preconceived notions about intelligence being predetermined.</li><br>

            <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
            <section>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>Physical activity.</code> This increases blood flow to the brain and delivers
                        sufficient supply of oxygen to the hungry neurons.</li>
                    <li><code>Paying attention.</code> Instead of acting in a very routinary (robotic) way, it is
                        important to think things through and be aware of our movements and the moments around us, such
                        as experiencing the smell of the flowers, being in the present, and engaging
                        in mindfulness activities.</li>
                    <li><code>Learning new things.</code> Be more open to doing new things. Get out of the comfort zone
                        of the familiar same old, same old.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4>What is GrowthMindset and why is it relevant?</h4>

            <p>The psychologist Carol Dweck debunked the implicit theory of intelligence (that it is static) and
                demonstrated how a growth mindset (that it can be developed) can play an important role in achieving
                success in life. Her research showed that the view we adopt about ourselves deeply affects the way
                we live our life. Those who believe that their abilities are set in stone (such as they are naturally intelligent without doing anything) have more tendency to seek recognition,
                validation, and approval. On the other hand, people with a growth mindset are passionate about learning and see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>
            <p>When encountering difficulties, people with a fixed mindset would attribute failure to the perception that they are not smart enough. I can't become this. But error and difficulty are normal when learning new things, and
                if we persist and keep developing our skills, we give the neurons in our brain the
                opportunity to make new connections. Eventually, we will get smarter. We should believe in the process
                and just keep pushing on.</p>


            <h4>Surprise!</h4>
            <p>An eye-opener for me in this exploration is how our abilities are capable of so much growth in all areas, including in our personal and social life. For instance, I am not very keen about
                exercising regularly, but now that I have learned how it helps feed the neurons in my brain, I think I
                am all set to do some brisk walking every day (when it is a good day -- sunny and not too cold or
                windy).</p>

            <h4>Integrating a growth mindset into my learning journey</h4>
            <p>One of the habits of successful people is having a growth mindset. As I am determined to be successful, I
                will integrate this growth mindset in my learning journey by being resilient when I encounter
                difficulties. I will focus my mind on the efforts I am making and remember that any difficulty I
                come across is just part of the learning process.</p>

            <h4>Blending a growth mindset into my learning plan and strategies</h4>
            <p>I have resolved to use the growth mindset in my Dev Academy journey with the following points as my
                guide:</p>

            <p><code>Persist in the face of setbacks.</code></p>
            <p>This course has definitely not been smooth-sailing. On my fourth week now of Foundations and every week
                there is a pattern of difficulty, persistence, and success. Somehow I have a better understanding of the fact that setbacks will always be part of my learning and I just have to embrace it and look it
                in the face because there is no other way to go about this path I have chosen. Instead, I should just
                focus on my efforts and my small successes which will ultimately build up my overall learning and abilities.</p>
            <p><code>Listen to feedback and learn from criticism</code></p>
            <p>It is not easy to listen to criticisms especially when you think you have done your best. When someone tells me what things I can still improve on, I always try to keep an open mind about it and focus on how I can improve. The whole point of me studying is so I can upskill myself and I should always welcome every opportunity to be mentored or to learn from my peers.</p>
            <p><code>Find inspiration from the success of others.</code></p>
            <p>I have learned so much from my peers in Foundations. Sharing our work on Slack has many objectives, and one is to inspire others. At the end of the week, I take the time to read their blogs to learn something new. Even though the topics we cover are the same, it is amazing how we have different interpretations and analogies which are so fun to read. I also take a lot of pointers from how they present their blog and codes, and I think it is something I would not learn if my mind were not open to learning something from others.</p>
