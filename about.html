                <p>Kumusta! My name is Claudette Cabahug, currently living in the beautiful little capital of New Zealand -- Wellington.</p>
                <p>Back home in the Philippines, I finished a degree in law and have had extensive experience in the
                    insurance
                    industry, particularly in the areas of sales, recruitment, and people management. At some point, I also
                    dabbled in content writing for the web, ensuring client sites are search engine optimised, and it was
                    something I really enjoyed.</p>
                <p>Now, I am embarking on the journey of my life. I have joined Enspiral Dev Academy hoping to become a web
                    developer before I turn 40! I am keen to work on projects that will help parents like me make their life
                    easier. However, I do welcome out-of-this-universe, mind-blowing ideas that will help make the
                    world a better place.</p>
