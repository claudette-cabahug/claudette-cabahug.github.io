            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Claudette Cabahug, currently living in the beautiful little capital of New Zealand,
                Wellington.</p>
            <p>Back home in the Philippines, I finished a degree in law and have had extensive experience in the insurance
                industry, particularly in the areas of sales, recruitment, and people management. At some point, I also
                dabbled in content writing for the web, ensuring client sites are search engine optimised, and it was
                something I really enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Now, I am embarking on the journey of my life. I have joined Enspiral Dev Academy hoping to become web
                developer before I turn 40! I am keen to work on projects that will help parents like me make their life
                easier. However, I do welcome out of this universe, blow my mind away ideas that will help make the world a
                better place.</p>
