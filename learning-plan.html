        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
        <p><strong>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I will make sure to put  in 8 hours of focused work/study every day from Monday to Friday. I will achieve this by using Toggle and the pomodoro method.</li>
                <li>I will aim to practice coding every day within the 40 hours per week schedule for the course and give regular updates to my facilitator on my progress.</li>
                <li>I will commit to make myself available whenever there are activities that EDA has prepared for me to work with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives.</li>
                <li>I will clearly set down my everyday/weekly chores at home and manage to do them strictly within their specified times.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I will reach out to my facilitator and cohort for support or advice.</li>
                <li>Whenever I need more time to complete my tasks, I will communicate this with my facilitator in a timely way</li>
                <li>I will aim to have another outlet that can help clear my brain of stress and pressure, such as exercising or watching an episode of my favourite show on Netflix or going out with the family</li>
                <li>I will write my feelings down on a journal/my reflections</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
        <p>I am highly motivated to finish this course and learn as much as I can so I will be ready to hit the ground running once it is completed. Thus, I commit to be open with my facilitator/s when it comes to my learning struggles and I will endeavour to do so in a timely manner. I will make sure my challenges will constantly be raised and discussed during one-on-one check-ins, or sooner through DMs on Slack or e-mail, if necessary.</p>

        <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>
        <p>As the course espouses flipped learning, I am aware that the facilitation team is there primarily to guide me as a student in the right direction. Thus, I don’t expect them to be in daily correspondence with me. Whenever I have an urgent problem, I know that I should first post the query on the proper Slack channels and ask help from my cohort before going to my facilitator. Any other concerns I have, I can wait until the next check-in to discuss them.</p>
        <p>During bootcamp, however, as it will be held on campus, I do expect the facilitators to be present onsite as well during the times when I am required to be there. I’m sure this will greatly help me proceed with projects efficiently and it is also a good learning experience to be coached and trained as if in the actual workplace.</p>

        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
        <p>For the entire 5 weeks of Foundations, I will be working/studying from home. Since starting the course during lockdown and with the children home during the day, I have been studying Monday to Friday from 3:00 PM till around midnight, with some interruption in between such as dinner time and cleaning up. Now that the kids are back in school with the lowering of the alert level, I can study on weekdays from 9:30 AM till 7:00 PM, with interruptions in between for lunch and school pick-up.</p>
        <p>On weekends, I block off my Saturday morning until late afternoon to spend time with the family and to go with the kids to their ballet and music lessons. For the rest of the weekend, I spend it doing chores and also practicing coding and watching video tutorials.</p>
